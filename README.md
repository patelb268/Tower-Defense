Welcome to the Tower Defense Game! This project was developed for the SER 427 final assignment using Unity. In this game, you'll take on the role of a defender tasked with protecting your base from waves of enemies. Utilize various towers strategically to fend off the hordes and emerge victorious!

## Game Concept
Tower Defense is a classic strategy game where players strategically place defensive structures, known as towers, along the enemy's path. The objective is to prevent the enemies from reaching your base by eliminating them before they can get there. Each tower has unique abilities, and as you progress, you can unlock new towers and upgrades to bolster your defenses.

## Game Design
The Tower Defense game was designed with a focus on engaging gameplay and challenging levels. The following design aspects were considered during development:

- **Level Design:** Each level is crafted with increasing difficulty and unique enemy patterns to keep players entertained and challenged.

- **Tower Mechanics:** Different towers are available, each with its own strengths, weaknesses, and abilities. Players must strategically choose and place towers to create effective defense strategies.

- **Resource Management:** Players have a limited amount of currency to build and upgrade towers. Wise resource management is essential for success.

- **Progression System:** As players successfully defend against waves of enemies, they can unlock new towers or upgrades, providing a sense of accomplishment and motivation to keep playing.

- **UI/UX:** A user-friendly interface was implemented to ensure a smooth and enjoyable gaming experience.

## Linear Vectors
Linear vectors play a crucial role in managing movement and interactions within the game. Some key areas where linear vectors are utilized include:

- **Enemy Movement:** Linear vectors are used to determine the direction and speed at which enemies move along the predefined paths towards the player's base.

- **Tower Targeting:** Calculations involving linear vectors help towers determine the direction in which they should shoot or apply special effects on enemy units.

- **Projectile Trajectory:** When towers fire projectiles, linear vectors are used to calculate the trajectory, ensuring accurate hits on enemy units.

## How to Play
1. **Objective:** Your objective is to defend your base from incoming waves of enemies. If an enemy reaches your base, you lose a life. Defend your base until all waves are defeated.

2. **Tower Placement:** Use the available currency to build towers along the enemy's path. Each tower costs a specific amount, so plan your placements carefully.

3. **Tower Upgrades:** As you progress or earn points, you can upgrade your towers to enhance their effectiveness against tougher enemies.

4. **Wave Management:** Each level consists of several waves of enemies. Prepare and strategize before each wave to handle increasingly challenging enemy units.

5. **Victory:** Successfully defend your base through all waves to achieve victory and move on to the next level.

## Development and Contributions
The Tower Defense Game was developed as a final assignment for the SER 427 course using Unity. It serves as an educational project and will not be actively maintained. However, contributions and suggestions are welcome.
